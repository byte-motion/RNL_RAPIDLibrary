# RnLibStateMachine.sys

## Usage

Easy start and stop functionality of statemachines. Statemachines is a convenient way of controlling several parts of a system in a manageable way. Basicly each part of a system will be in a "state", and depending on where in each sequence each part of the system is a different procedure will be scanned.

Will scan each machines state each 1000ms. Otherwise will watch subscribes program-data and I/O, and scan corresponding statemachine upon value-changes.

Timer functionality based off unixtime. Simply number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 (Resolution 1 second). For highres timers, use clock.

Statemachines, subscriptions and timers are created and destroyed using objectoriented-like syntax.

OBS! Do not use instructions that will halt the scan functionality. Ex. WaitTime, WaitIntil etc.

## Installation

1. Load modules in designated task.
* MainModule.mod
* StateMachineMod.sys
* StateExampleMod.mod

2. Define the initial statemachine(s) in MainModule/Main.

## Example Statemachine

*Example OpPanelMod (Example-statemachine):*
```
    LOCAL PROC Init(string ModName)
        ...
        Id:=NewStateMachine(ModName,"Operator Panel");
        Subscribe Id,["bAccessWanted","Id","diAccessWanted","diResetAndStart","sdoRunChainOk","sdoMotorsOnState","sdoCycleOn"];
    ENDPROC
```
Init procedure will create statemachine object and subscribe to relevant programdata and I/O.

For the example statemachine OpPanelMod, we start by initiating some programdata, then create an object for the statemachine that will control the OpPanel. Once we have a statemachine, we can subscribe to relevant I/O and programdata. Note that when subscribing we also point to the relevant statemachine pointer.


```
    LOCAL PROC Main()
        IF diAccessWanted=1 AND doOpPanelDoorLock<>0 SetState Id,"AccessWanted_10";
        IF bAccessWanted AND sdoCycleOn=0 SetState Id,"DoorUnlock_10";
        IF diResetAndStart=1 AND sdoCycleOn=0 SetState Id,"ResetAndStart_10";
    ENDPROC
```
Main will be the main entrypoint and default state when the statemachine is idle. Once any sequence becomes ready it will change state to the specified sequence.


```
    LOCAL PROC AccessWanted_10()
        bResetStart:=FALSE;
        bAccessWanted:=(NOT bAccessWanted);
        ForceUnlock_:=NewTimer(Id,5,"DoorUnlock_10");
        SetState Id,"AccessWanted_20";
    ENDPROC

    LOCAL PROC AccessWanted_20()
        IF diAccessWanted=0 THEN
            DeleteTimer ForceUnlock_;
            SetState Id,"Main";
        ENDIF
    ENDPROC
```
Typical sequence will consist one state setting some I/O and then change to the next state which will wait for something to finnish. Then return to the main state and wait for a new sequence to become ready.


## Configure initial Statemachines

*Example MainModule/Main (configuration):*
```
    PROC Main()
        ! Statemachine Init
        %"StateMachineMod:Init"%;
        
        ! Call the Init procedure for statemachine.
        %"OpPanelMod:Init"%"OpPanelMod";
        %"OpPanelMod_Lights:Init"%"OpPanelMod_Lights";
        
        ! Start
        StateMachineStart;
    ENDPROC

```
This will call OpPanelMod:Init with modulename as argument. Late binding is used, and we can set everything as LOCAL in each statemachine.

For the example statemachine OpPanelMod, we start by initiating some programdata, then create an object for the statemachine that will control the OpPanel. Once we have a statemachine, we can subscribe to relevant I/O and programdata. Note that when subscribing we also point to the relevant statemachine pointer.
